Public repository project for OOP TU857/2 


Java Submission for OOProject, choosing the search engine for files.


In this file, i created a GUI that will show multiple outputs, and requires certain input from the user, for example the selection asks for the user to input,
to be searched on the file system, and then they will be required to check and choose which files they would like too search the terms in.


I used J file chooser for my file choice class, this allows the user to select the directory and different types of folders, 
I then read the file in with a buffered reader input stream, which will read the line, line by line.

The app then asks for the user to input the searchable terms, When given a correct search term, the jarea box will output the matches found, and where matches where not mad that will also be highlighted.

In the background its also checking against each files to ensure the files content has what is desired to be searched.

The type of error checking is the try catches, and exception errors, this is in place to ensure the user inputs the right file,
The right primitive data to be searched within the file, and if any errors arise it will let the user know through the application window

If i had more time, i would spend it more so on the core functionality to ensure the most through file checking and searching with a fast algorithm design.

I would also avail of the open google API for the spell amending and checking, this would compare the values in the file, and the values given too the search box to be checked,
against the dictionary, and would allow for the user to have the file re-emended and re-wrote if so desired with correct spelling and punctuation
